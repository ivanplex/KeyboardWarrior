# KeyboardWarrior

KeyboardWarriror is a realtime multiplayer game that allows users to
compete against one another in typing out the excerpts. Users
will have to log in with their Google account, and can set their nickname.
Upon joining a game users will be placed in a lobby, which will fill up
with other users. The game starts when there is sufficient players and ends
when the time runs out or when the user finishes the game. The game keeps
track of the users' accuracies and words-per-minute.
